    <h1>About</h1>
    <h2>Our mission</h2>
    <p>We want to exercise every vested and exercisable employee option grant. Leveling the playing field for unicorn employees.</p>

    <h2>Nikkl provides capital to unicorn employees, so that employees can exercise their vested options to purchase shares, significantly reduce their taxes, and gain near-term liquidity.</h2>

    <h2>Our vision is to help unicorn employees thrive in the new private market.</h2>
    <p>Nikkl was founded in response to the rising financial risks of holding equity in a successful startup company. Many unicorn employees take huge financial losses due to expensive upfront costs, tax complexities and long exit windows. The more successful the company, the more complex these risks can become. Nikkl is here to help inform unicorn employees about the new private market and to help them keep the equity they have already earned.</p>

    <h2>Meet the team</h2>
    <p>Nikkl is led by Dan Siciliano who is the Chair Elect of Federal Home Loan Bank Council and was formerly a Professor of the Practice and Associate Dean at Stanford Law School. Dan was also the co-founder and CEO of LawLogix, a global software technology company ranked several times as one of the Top 100 fastest growing private software companies in the US, and named to the US Hispanic Business 500 lists for 2010 and 2011.</p>
